# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(T):
    # Read X and Y
    X, Y = map(int, input().strip().split())
    
    # Calculate total cost
    total_cost = X * Y
    
    # Output the total cost
    print(total_cost)

08)How many unattempted problems
CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:

Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests
Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs
Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience
